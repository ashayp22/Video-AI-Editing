# Video AI Editing

**What does this program do?**

Given an input video, the program detects any smiles within the video and edits an image in all 4 corners of the screen. The more a person smiles in the video, the more of the image is shown. After the program goes through the entire video, an edited video is saved. This is done with a Haar Cascade and Convolutional Neural Network.
